        <div class="title">Node is not in sync!</div>
        <div class="subtitle">Node.JS is an asynchronous language that works different!</div>
        <div class="text">
            We all have used Node in our daily lives or at least heard of it at least 
            once in the coding world. But do you actually know what Node is?
            Node.JS is a simulated environment that acts like a browser. Simply put, whatever the 
            browser does, the same thing can be done in Node. So you need not open your browser for 
            console logs or responses from servers anymore. But why use Node when the browser already exists?
            Here's why..
            <br><br>
            Node by default works in a synchronous manner using a single thread. That means like JS, Python,
            Java and so on it takes a command or a piece of code, processess it and then goes to the next line.
            Meaning it can handle only one task(piece of code) at a time. We are also used to this as we write
            our code from top to bottom as that is the order of execution followed. <br>
            But Node has an option to be asynchronous. So when we use this option, it starts executing a code 
            and as soon as the execution has started, it will go on to the next piece of code without waiting for
            the result of that piece of code that is being processed. This is nothing but <b>multi tasking</b>.
            So when it taks more time to process the code we can parellelly execute a different piece of code 
            thus resulting in reducing the time taken to execute the code.
            <br>
            However, use async feature only when you do not have a dependency on the previous lines and when
            you are ok to get the output in a jumbled order,as we don't know which task will be finsihed
            first while multitasking.
            <br><br>
            <pre>
            Syntax:
            async function myFunction() {
                return "Hello";
              }
              myFunction().then(
                function(value) {myDisplayer(value);},
                function(error) {myDisplayer(error);}
              );
            </pre>
            Here as you can see as myFunction is an async function, so whatever is called inisde it will
            execute parellelly and whichever execution is finished first it will be displayed first (assuming
            the display was a part of the code being executed).
            <br><br>
            Hope you learnt something from this and you can give it a shot in the Mark13 assignment 
            where we need to have the DSA for different formats of date.
